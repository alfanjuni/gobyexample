# const Keyword Example

In Go, the `const` keyword is used to declare constants, which are immutable values that cannot be changed once declared. This example demonstrates:

- **`const Pi float64 = 3.1415`**: Declares a constant for the value of Pi.
- **`const WelcomeMessage string = "Hello, Go developer!"`**: Declares a string constant.

### How to Run the Example

Navigate to the directory and run the following command:

```bash
go run examples/golang-25-magic-keywords/05-const/main.go 
```
