# import Keyword Example

In Go, the `import` keyword is used to bring external packages into your program. In this example, we import two standard library packages:

- **`fmt`**: For formatted output, like printing messages to the console.
- **`time`**: For working with dates and times.

### How to Run the Example

Navigate to the directory and run the following command:

```bash
go run examples/golang-25-magic-keywords/02-import/main.go
```
