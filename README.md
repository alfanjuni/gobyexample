# Go By Example

Welcome to the **Go By Example** repository! This project is a comprehensive collection of Go programming language tutorials, starting from basic concepts and progressing to advanced topics. Each example is accompanied by code and explanations to help you understand key Go language features.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured into multiple directories, each focusing on specific Go concepts. Each folder contains Go code examples and a README file explaining the example in detail.

### Folder Structure

### How to Use This Repository

Each folder inside this repository focuses on a specific topic or concept in Go programming. Here's how to get started:

1. Navigate to a specific topic (e.g., `examples/golang-25-magic-keywords/01-package/`).
2. Read the `README.md` file within that folder for an explanation of the concept.
3. Check the corresponding `main.go` file for a runnable Go example.
4. You can run the code examples on your local machine by cloning the repository and running each `main.go` file.

### Cloning the Repository

To clone this repository and try the examples locally, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alfanjuni/gobyexample.git
```

Then, navigate into the folder of the example you want to run. For example, to run the example on `package`:

```bash
cd gobyexample/examples/golang-25-magic-keywords/01-package
go run main.go
```

### Topics Covered

1. **Basic Structure Keywords**: Learn the fundamental keywords that define the structure of a Go program, including `package`, `import`, `func`, `var`, and `const`.
